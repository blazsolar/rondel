# Rondel

Rondel is an annotation processor that makes use of [Dagger](http://google.github.io/dagger/) easier on Android.

## Limitations

At the moment there are still a few limitations when using Rondel.

 * Views can not depend on Fragments as parent.
 * No extra parameters can't be send to modules.
